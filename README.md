<h1>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspHi, I'm a malware enthousiast, pentester and reverse engineer! </h1>

<p>I make projects && content purely for educational purposes, to learn myself things and to potentially learn other people something new.</p>

<p>I code within these programming and-or markup languages</p>
<ul>
  <li>Rust (my main and goto language for bigger projects)</li>
  <li>Python for quick PoC's</li>
  <li>PHP / HTML / CSS (For all my web needs)</li>
